PLANS FOR PROGRAM TESTING

We wrote two classes for this program: TopSecret and FileHandler.


TESTS FOR FILEHANDLER
FileHandler does not depend on TopSecret, so no Mockito will be used. A way to eliminate FileHandlerTest's dependence on our data folder is described below.

We will run tests using a temporary directory that will be filled with 3 test files that will be generated before every test (filea.txt, fileb.txt, filec.txt)
This makes it so that the FileHandler tests don't depend on what is in our data directory at the time of the test

getAvailableFiles() --> should return a list containing "filea.txt", "fileb.txt", "filec.txt", sorted alphabetically
getAvailableFiles() on empty directory --> empty list
reading from filea, b, or c should return the proper file contents
trying to read a nonexistent file should throw an exception
reading from an empty file --> ""
reading from a multiline file --> should return proper contents with white space and newlines maintained
we should not be able to instantiate a FileHandler on an invalid directory path




TESTS FOR TOPSECRET
TopSecret depends on FileHandler, so we will mock a fileHandler object to use for all our tests. The default behavior of this mock object will be
to return a list of ten files named firstfile.txt, secondfile.txt... whenever getAvailableFiles() is called. This removes the dependency on the performance of FileHandler's methods.

TopSecret has only one method to be tested---main. The following tests will make sure that main runs properly with varying args passed to it, including thrown exceptions for invalid args

no args --> prints the correct list of ten files from our mock FileHandler. 01 firstfile.txt\n02 secondfile.txt, and so on
01 --> fileName field set to "firstfile.txt"
1 cipherkey --> fileName field set to "firstfile.txt"
10 --> fileName field set to "tenthfile.txt"
0010 cipherkey --> fileName field set to "tenthfile.txt"
123abc --> exception thrown, nonnumeric input
-1 --> exception thrown, arg below lower bound
14 --> exception thrown, arg above upper bound
"" --> exception thrown, nonnumeric input
If FileHandler throws an exception for an invalid fileName, TopSecret throws an exception as well
