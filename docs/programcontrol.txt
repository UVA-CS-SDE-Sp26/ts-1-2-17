PLANS FOR PROGRAM TESTING
2/5/26
Leonardo Valli

Since our entire program for this assignment will live inside TopSecret.java,
we will write JUnit tests for specifically that class

There are two things we can test for in TopSecret.java:
- after instantiation of a TopSecret object, the fileName field should be set to the right name,
corresponding with the file number that the user provided as a command line argument
    - Testing for this will simply involve a few JUnit methods that instantiate TopSecret objects,
    and assertEquals() to compare the fileName field to what we expect it to be
        - Test with file number 0, 1, and a two invalid file numbers (index out of bounds),
        one too large and one too small (negative)
- We can also test the TopSecret method that takes in a fileName and returns the contents of that file
    - this can also be done with assertEquals()
        - test returning the contents of an empty file, a 1 line file, and a multi-line file
            - method must preserve white-space (returns)
